# myClimaApp 

myClimaApp it's a simple weather app using cocoapods such as SwiftyJSON and Alamofire and openweathermap API. 
Make sure to install cocoapods and to replace the appid variable with your own app id for the app to work..
So all you need to do is set up your own free account on OpenWeatherMap and get a free appid.
